"""
DESCRIPTION:
Program designed to take a fasta file and extract all the GATC digestion fragments in this genome

INPUTS:
--genome takes the path to the genome from which you want to extract the GATC fragments from

OUTPUTS:
bed file of the following format: chrom_id   start   stop
gff file containing the same informations
tsv file containing the kallisto target_id to 'gene_id' conversion file 
    containing the chrom start and stop in the geneID

OTHER OPTIONS:
--salmon option will add an identifier in place of the chromosome name to the bed file
--overlap option will cause the script to count the whole GATC site in the fragment
--overlap_size option allows the user to input a custom overlap to the fragments


DISCLAIMER:
This program is designed to be used as a part of a nextflow pipeline, so it will 
output the files in root directory
